# [Python] Linear Regression-House Loan Amount Prediction
This project implements a full-cycle linear regression workflow to predict housing loan amounts based on customer profiles and property characteristics. The dataset contains demographic, income, and property data for thousands of applicants.

## I. INTRODUCTION

### Problem Statement

A financial institution wants to predict how much loan a customer is eligible for, based on demographic and property data. The task is to help build a regression model that can accurately predict **Loan Sanction Amount (USD)**, and analyze key factors influencing loan decisions.

## II. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
### Data Overview

- **Target Variable:** `Loan Sanction Amount (USD)`
- **Features:**
  - Gender, Age, Income (USD), Income Stability
  - Property Age, Property Location, Property Price

### Data Processing Step
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
2. Handling **missing values** & encoding categorical variables with `get_dummies`
3. Creating new features like:
   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**
   - **Loan-to-Income (LTI) Ratio**
   - **Borrower Risk Level** using quantile binning

## III. MODELING WORKFLOW

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Preprocessing | Cleaned and encoded data |
| Train-Test Split | 80/20 ratio |
| Model | Linear Regression (`scikit-learn`) |
| Evaluation | MAE, MSE, RÂ² Score |

### Performance Metrics

- **MAE:** 127.84  
- **MSE:** 2,290,198.04  
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.9978 âœ…

### Feature Engineering
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**  
  Helps evaluate how much of the propertyâ€™s value is covered by the loan.
  
- **Loan-to-Income (LTI) Ratio**  
  Used to assess financial risk. Customers were segmented into:
  - `Low Risk`
  - `Medium Risk`
  - `High Risk`

## IV. DATA PROCESSING & VISUALIZATION

After reviewing the dataset, we started by removing missing values (81 rows) and confirming data types were consistent across numerical and categorical fields.

To prepare the data:
- We used get_dummies() for categorical features (Gender, Property Location, Income Stability)
- Created two new engineered features:
  - Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV) = Loan / Property Price
  - Loan-to-Income Ratio (LTI) = Loan / Income

- Based on LTI values, customers were segmented into:
  - Low Risk
  - Medium Risk
  - High Risk

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/475dde1c-d884-43bb-a090-f831b7699d85)
Divide the data into training and test sets with a suitable ratio (e.g., 80/20) to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

## V. KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Does income or income stability affect loan amounts?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89eb4d0a-f268-4975-926c-7dcbdc183f1a)
- **Income** has a stronger correlation with loan amount (r â‰ˆ 0.39)
- **Income Stability** shows very weak correlation (r â‰ˆ 0.07)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87b46065-5c1f-4358-99d5-e3ddf6558cd6)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010eedab-9bcf-4b57-bdc9-1833e8c95465)
- Regression confirms that income has a moderate positive effect on loan amounts. Higher income = higher loan amounts.
- Income strongly influences loan amounts, while income stability plays a minimal role.
- Banks prioritize income levels over stability when deciding loan approvals.

### 2. Property Location Impact

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a180fa-0ed2-4e08-b259-8098eb4ea3f9)
- **No statistically significant** difference in loan amount between rural, urban, and semi-urban properties. (ANOVA p > 0.72)

### 3. Gender Bias?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/496a83db-8183-49ac-8a2f-a84c0452885b)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b04cf3-d91c-42f4-8399-d258b4f92373)

- No evidence of gender bias found in loan sanction amounts. (p = 0.46)
### 4. Borrower Risk Segmentation (LTI-based)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7e8d0bf-b885-4f00-8ff7-b29722ff7d04)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4ee5a67-5d30-4cbe-81bd-582a8fc7ac76)

- Low-risk customers tend to receive higher average loans
- High-risk customers are more tightly distributed at lower values
- This segmentation can guide targeted financial strategies and risk management
